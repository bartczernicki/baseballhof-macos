Visual Studio Mac Project using ML.NET .NET Core library to predict Baseball Hall Of Fame Induction for batters

Project uses selected historical baseball batting data from 1900-2015

A binary classifier is used to train a yes/no prediction and persist a model.  The model is used to predict HOF induction on a validation set, which outputs a list of metrics and correct/incorrect predictions.
